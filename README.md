# PUBLIC-MEDICAL-DATA
Hello there!  This is just a basic idea of what we dynamites are planning to do in this hackthemountain  So the basic idea is that from our software every citizen of India will have its own unique medical I'd which would be linked to his/her adhaar number. From this unique medical Id  The doctors will be able to access to the medical history, list of allergic medicine and past addictive drugs of any patient easily. For the privacy and safety concerns all this data of a person will be secured by biometric password and his/her nominee details.  As in some cases patients died during the treatment because doctors taken time to do those tests which should have done before but with our software doctor will get all the medical information about any patient in some seconds  This will also help a lot of people by they will not have to Cary had copies or original documents and all this above info pros makes a our project  As  "PUBLIC MEDICAL DATA"
